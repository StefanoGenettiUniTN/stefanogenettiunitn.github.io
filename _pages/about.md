Hello world!
======
Welcome to my personal webpage!
I'm **Stefano Genetti**, a **PhD student in Industrial Innovation** at the University of Trento, in collaboration with Adige (BLM Group), a global leader in CNC laser cutting machines for tubes.
My research focuses on driving innovation at Adige by supporting the transition toward Industry 4.0. Currently, I'm developing an interpretable AI solution that combines grammatical evolution and reinforcement learning to evolve decision tree agents for production scheduling. The system is integrated into an interactive simulation-optimization framework, designed with a human-in-the-loop approach to include expert knowledge in the optimization process and enhance decision-making.
This work is part of the broader PhD project whose aim is to design a digital twin infrastructure for Adigeâ€™s supply chain, leveraging data and AI to enable data-informed decisions across operations.
In addition to research, I'm a teaching assistant for several courses at the University of Trento, including Distributed Systems, AI for Medicine, and Computer Architectures. I also supervise student projects on AI applications in industrial contexts.

**BLM Research Internship** I am currently participating in a research internship with [BLM Group](https://www.blmgroup.com/it/), working under the guidance of Alberto Longobardi, the Production Director at BLM, and Professor Giovanni Iacca. The primary focus of my project is to explore the concept of digital twins and to develop simulation optimization algorithms. Our goal is to create innovative solutions and identify potential issues within the company's supply chain, ultimately enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness.

**Hypergraph Summarization Research** I'm contributing to a research project under the supervision of Professor Alberto Montresor, PhD student Francesco Lotito, Giulia Preti (Researcher at [CENTAI](https://centai.eu/home)). With our work, we are introducing the first algorithmic solution to the novel problem of Hypergraph Summarization. Our aim is to publish a scientific paper based on our findings.

**E-Agle Trento Racing team** I'm excited to be part of the University of Trento's Formula Student Team. Here, my primary focus is on developing software solutions for the creation of a perceptron system for our autonomous vehicle competing in Formula Driverless competitions. Specifically, we're working on a visual SLAM solution that combines the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm with YOLO. This system allows the vehicle to localize itself on the track while identifying cones and their coordinates to construct a map of the circuit.

Beyond my academic commitments, I enjoy engaging in various projects. In the recent years, the university occupies most of my time, as a consequence, my main extracurricular activities revolve around providing technical support to individuals, such as hardware repairs and consultancy. Living in a small village, I'm often the go-to person for technical assistance. I also have a passion for developing software solutions, including websites, web applications and management software for small clients.

<!--Apart from my computer science interests, I pursue other hobbies. Recently, I joined an amateur volleyball team of wonderful people called *Diaspeck Volley Bolghera* where I play as a libero.-->
