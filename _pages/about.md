Hello world!
======
Welcome to my personal webage. My name is **Stefano Genetti**. I'm currently a student at the University of Trento, enrolled in the **Master's degree in Computer Science**.
My journey into the world of computer science began at a young age when my father introduced me to a computer, igniting a lifelong passion for this captivating field. I find various areas of computer science intriguing, from data science and artificial intelligence to networking. My curiosity spans across diverse realms of computer science, encompassing topics from data science and artificial intelligence to distributed systems.
Presently, I invest most of my time in the following activities:

**Hypergraph Summarization Research** I'm contributing to a research project under the supervision of Professor Alberto Montresor and PhD student Francesco Lotito. With our work, we are introducing the first algorithmic solution to the novel problem of Hypergraph Summarization. Our aim is to publish a scientific paper based on our findings.

**E-Agle Trento Racing team** I'm excited to be part of the University of Trento's Formula Student Team. Here, my primary focus is on developing software solutions for the creation of a perceptron system for our autonomous vehicle competing in Formula Driverless competitions. Specifically, we're working on a visual SLAM solution that combines the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm with YOLO. This system allows the vehicle to localize itself on the track while identifying cones and their coordinates to construct a map of the circuit.

**English Certification** I'm preparing to achieve a Cambridge C1 Advanced English certification in December in order to improve and certify my language skills.

**Internship Search** I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity to conclude my university career. My aspiration is to attend an internship program abroad. This would be an incredible opportunity to discover new things, face new problems, broaden my horizons, connect with professionals in the field, discover new cultures. Furthermore, this would allow me to better understand what I want to pursue in my future after university.

**University Courses** At the university, I'm currently enrolled in the *Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence* course, exploring evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence. Additionally, I'm delving into *Low-Power Wireless Networking for the Internet of Things*, which has introduced me to the exciting world of low-power wireless communication technologies. Furthermore, I'm enhancing my writing skills through the *Technical Writing* course, which also aligns with my preparation for the C1 certification.

Beyond my academic commitments, I enjoy engaging in various projects. In the recent years, the university occupies most of my time, as a consequence, my main extracurricular activities revolve around providing technical support to individuals, such as hardware repairs and consultancy. Living in a small village, I'm often the go-to person for technical assistance. I also have a passion for developing software solutions, including websites and management software for small clients.
Apart from my computer science interests, I pursue other hobbies. Recently, I joined an amateur volleyball team of wonderful people called *Diaspeck Volley Bolghera* where I play as a libero.
